With AI reporting tools now embedded in platforms like Microsoft and Google Workspace, manual client reports are becoming a huge hidden cost.

Many teams still spend hours pulling data, formatting summaries, and preparing weekly updates — and that’s where critical insights often get missed.

I built a workflow that:
• Fetches client data automatically
• Summarizes the insights with AI
• Flags potential churn risks
• Emails a clean PDF report to clients
• Runs entirely on n8n + AI

Impact:
Over 6 hours saved each week while getting clearer visibility into client health.

As AI-powered reporting becomes the norm across major productivity tools, staying manual puts teams at a disadvantage.

Which report in your workflow consumes the most hours every week?
